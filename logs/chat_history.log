Agent: Supervisor Plan: It seems like the goal is not clearly defined. However, I'll assume the goal is to assist a customer with an auto finance-related issue. Here's a possible sequence of tasks:

Step 1: Verification Agent - Verify the customer's identity to ensure we're speaking with the correct person.

Step 2: SOP Agent - Explain the procedures and insurance coverage related to the customer's auto finance account to understand their query.

Step 3: SOP Agent - If the customer has a specific issue with their loan, EMI, or due date, the SOP Agent will guide them to the correct agent.

Step 4: Payment Agent - If the customer's issue is related to their loan, EMI, or due date, the Payment Agent will handle the query and provide assistance.

Step 5: Claim Agent - If the customer's issue is related to an accident or theft claim, the Claim Agent will handle the query and provide assistance.

Step 6: Verification Agent - If the customer's issue requires verification of their identity or account information, the Verification Agent will assist.

Step 7: SOP Agent - If the customer has any further questions or concerns, the SOP Agent will provide additional guidance and support.
